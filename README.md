# libft

## Introduction
_libft_ is a simple library written in C language which replicates the functionality of the following system functions:
  - memset
  - bzero
  - memcpy
  - memccpy
  - memmove
  - memchr
  - memcmp
  - strlen
  - strlcpy
  - strlcat
  - strchr
  - strrchr
  - strnstr
  - strncmp
  - atoi
  - isalpha
  - isdigit
  - isalnum
  - isascii
  - isprint
  - toupper
  - tolower

## Prerequisites
1. _gcc_ compiler

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute the command `make` to compile the library.
3. Include this library in any of your C files and don't forget to link it with the compiler.
4. Voila! You can now use all those cool functions mentioned above using MY library. Why use the built in functions when you can go through all the pain and suffering of downlaoding and compiling then having to explicitly link my library with your c files, just to get the same functionality? After all, it ain't no secret that it is the process of overcoming pain and suffering that gives us the type of pleasure which is most fulfilling.
